# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge 🌈
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

In particular, this community is a **safe space for LGBTQIA+ individuals**. As the creator and maintainer of this project, I, **Nolly**, am a non-binary human. I will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or transphobic behavior within this community.

## Our Standards 🌟
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- **🌱 Being inclusive and welcoming** to all.
- **🌼 Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.**
- **🎨 Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.**
- **📚 Focusing on what is best for the community.**
- **💖 Showing empathy towards other community members.**
- **🚫 Standing up against bullying, harassment, and discrimination.**
-
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- **💢 The use of sexualized language or imagery**, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- **❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks.
- **⚠️ Public or private harassment**.
- **🛑 Publishing others’ private information**, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- **🚫 Any transphobic, homophobic, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes or language**.
- **❗ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.**

## Our Responsibilities 🎯
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope 🌍
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement 🛡️
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me directly at [nolly.berrebi@gmail.com](mailto:nolly.berrebi@gmail.com) or via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thenolle/desktop-pet/issues). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community members are expected to comply with this Code of Conduct. Those who violate these guidelines will be subject to consequences deemed appropriate, which may include a temporary or permanent ban from the community.
